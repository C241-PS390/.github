# About Our Team
## Preserving and Promoting the Rich Cultural Heritage of Batik
Batik is a rich cultural heritage of Indonesia, filled with historical value and uniqueness. One of its distinguishing features is the diversity of its types. Batik patterns vary not only in motifs, shapes, and colors but also carry their own meanings and stories behind each design. Despite this richness, public understanding or knowledge about batik remains minimal. This is particularly evident in the current digital era, where many aspects of traditional culture are being influenced by ongoing modernization.

However, in this digital age, advancements in computer vision technology have created new opportunities to preserve and introduce batik to a wider audience.

## Our Mission
Based on this premise, our team has formulated the question: "How can artificial intelligence technology be applied to help enhance the knowledge and interest of Indonesian society in the cultural heritage of batik?". To address this, we are planning to develop an AI-based batik pattern classifier application. Our mission is to preserve and promote the richness of batik through an application that can automatically recognize and classify batik motifs.

## Our Vision
By leveraging artificial intelligence technology, we aim to:

1. Enhance public knowledge and interest in the cultural heritage of batik.
2. Provide an educational tool that makes learning about batik patterns engaging and accessible.
3. Utilize computer vision advancements to create a bridge between traditional culture and modern technology.
4. Contribute to the preservation of Indonesia's cultural heritage in the digital era.

Join us in our journey to blend tradition with technology and bring the beautiful world of batik to the fingertips of many.
